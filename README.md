# 🧠 JavaScript DSA Practice

Welcome to my **JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository**!  
This repository showcases my **problem-solving skills**, **coding efficiency**, and **readiness for technical interviews**.  

---

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repo contains my structured practice of **core DSA concepts in JavaScript**, including:

- **Data Structures:** Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs  
- **Algorithms:** Sorting, Searching, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, and more  
- **Optimized Solutions:** Focused on **time & space complexity**  
- **Interview-Oriented Problems:** Inspired by platforms like **LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces**
